*stress-ng* can stress various system resources such as CPU, cache,
disk, memory, socket pipe I/O, scheduling and much more.

Stress-ng has a wide range of CPU-specific stress tests that exercise
floating point, integer, bit manipulation and control flow. In this step
of the lab, we will use the CPU-intensive matrix stressor, which is one
of the many tests that heats CPUs the best.

NOTE: For the following instruction, you will need to click the "terminal" tab in the top left of your screen.

Using the terminal window, the stress-ng matrix stressor -

....
stress-ng --matrix 0 -t 45s
....

The stressor should run for a 45-second duration and will drive up CPU
utilization across both the v-CPUs on the instance.

NOTE: For the following instruction, you will need to click the "Web Console" tab in the top left of your screen.

While stress-ng is still running, you will see that the 2 CPUs are hot
on the CPU tile in the web console

NOTE: To see the updated results, you may also need to click the button "Load earlier data" in the bottom middle of the screen

The CPU graph will also be updated with the *CPU spike* message and graph.

To continue click the "Next" button located at the botton left of your screen.
