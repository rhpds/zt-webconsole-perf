*stress-ng* can stress various system resources such as CPU, cache,
disk, memory, socket pipe I/O, scheduling and much more.

Stress-ng has a wide range of CPU-specific stress tests that exercise
floating point, integer, bit manipulation and control flow. In this step
of the lab, we will use the CPU-intensive matrix stressor, which is one
of the many tests that heats CPUs the best.

Using the terminal window, the stress-ng matrix stressor -

....
stress-ng --matrix 0 -t 45s
....

The stressor should run for a 45-second duration and will drive up CPU
utilization across both the v-CPUs on the instance.

While stress-ng is still running, you will see that the 2 CPUs are hot
on the CPU tile in the web console


The CPU graph will also be updated with the *CPU spike* message and
